This module provides functions to analyze crop images using Gemini Vision (Google Vertex AI Multimodal API).
It detects crop diseases and suggests remedies based on the image input.

Main function:
    diagnose_crop(image_bytes: bytes) -> dict
        # Accepts image bytes, returns disease diagnosis and treatment suggestions.
"""
def diagnose_crop(image_file):
    # Placeholder logic for now
    _ = image_file
    return {
        "diagnosis": "Early blight detected",
        "advice": "Spray with a copper-based fungicide"
    }
