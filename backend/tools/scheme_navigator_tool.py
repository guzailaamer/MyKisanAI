Scheme Navigator Tool
--------------------
This module provides functions for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) over government scheme documents.
It uses Gemini Pro (Google Vertex AI) to answer user queries about subsidies and eligibility.

Main function:
    answer_scheme_query(query: str, user_profile: dict = None) -> dict
        # Returns answer, eligibility criteria, and relevant links for the user's subsidy question.
""" 

def answer_scheme_query(query_text):
    # Placeholder: no actual RAG yet
    _ = query_text
    return {
        "eligible": True,
        "scheme_name": "PM Krishi Sinchai Yojana",
        "steps": [
            "Visit your nearest Krishi office",
            "Fill subsidy form online",
            "Upload Aadhaar and land records"
